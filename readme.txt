Zong! Free
**********


To create the distribution packages for Linux, Windows, MacOSX,
Solaris and source, call "ant" in this directory. You will find
the packages in dist/packages/ then.


To open Zong! in Eclipse for developing and testing, do the following:

1) Open Eclipse and use this directory as the workspace
2) Import the Zong! projects:
   File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace ->
   Next -> Select this directory as the "root directory" ->
   Select all projects -> Finish
3) Import the Zong! user libraries:
   Window -> Preferences -> Java -> Build Paths -> User Libraries ->
   Import -> Browse -> Select "zong.userlibraries" in the "lib"
   subfolder -> OK -> OK

Now, you can for example start the Zong! Player by right-clicking
Player.launch in the player project and selecting Run as > Player.

Have fun! And please tell us if you have any problems.
